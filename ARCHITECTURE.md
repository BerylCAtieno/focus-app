# Architecture Overview
This document describes the architecture of the productivity app.

## Components
- **React Native**: UI implementation.
- **Apollo Server**: GraphQL server for data management.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing application data.
- **Firebase Authentication**: User authentication.

## Data Flow
- User interactions trigger GraphQL queries/mutations.
- Apollo Client communicates with Apollo Server.
- Apollo Server interacts with PostgreSQL for data storage.
- Firebase handles user authentication.

## Directory Structure
- `src/components/`: React Native components.
- `src/graphql/`: GraphQL schema and resolvers.
- `src/services/`: Services for interacting with Firebase and other external APIs.
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions.


## Other Considerations

Firebase Analytics: For tracking user interactions and app usage patterns.
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): For push notifications to alert users about their pomodoro cycles, tasks, or other important updates.

## dev tools
Jest: For unit testing your React Native components and logic.
Cypress/Detox: For end-to-end testing of your React Native application.
Postman/Newman: For testing your GraphQL API endpoints.
